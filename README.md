Developed at York College of Pennsylvania for CS360 "Analysis of Algorithms" under the supervision of Prof. David Babcock. 

## Usability

The implementation is set up to run a battery of tests for a number of random square graphs. This will be modified as the testing environment is refined. It measures the time the algorithm takes in nanoseconds. The Node class represents the individual vertices in the graph, and the Edge class represents the weights between them.
